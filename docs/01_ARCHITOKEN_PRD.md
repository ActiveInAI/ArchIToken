# ArchIToken Product Requirements Document

**Status**: active PRD baseline  
**Product**: ArchIToken, formerly InsomeOS  
**Scope**: AEC full-lifecycle operational platform, 11 modules, module workbench, file system, AI gates and digital twin  

---

## 1. Product Background

ArchIToken is an AI-native AEC Harness platform for heavy-steel structure projects and adjacent BIM/digital-twin workflows. The product is designed to make engineering work executable, traceable and governable across customer intake, design, costing, supply chain, manufacturing, construction, digital twin and archive.

The platform is not a static dashboard. It must behave as a business operating system:

- Every business module is entered by active `module_id`.
- Every file, artifact, approval, transaction and AI action leaves evidence.
- Generator and Evaluator are separate.
- Digital twin prioritizes WebGPU and keeps Three.js as fallback.
- Data access goes through StorageRouter capabilities, not direct product coupling.
- Local private deployment with Docker and Kubernetes is a first-class requirement.

## 5. File And Folder System Requirements

Every module must expose a module-scoped file explorer. It must support folders and files, and preserve state during the current session when backed by mock adapter.

Required node fields:

```text
id, name, type, moduleId, parentId, size, mimeType, status,
version, owner, updatedAt, tags, permissions, auditTrail
```

Left-click behavior:

| Target | Required Behavior |
|---|---|
| Folder | Open folder and display children |
| File | Open preview drawer or details panel |

Double-click behavior:

| Target | Required Behavior |
|---|---|
| Folder | Enter folder |
| File | Full-view mode |

Right-click operations:

| Operation | Required Behavior |
|---|---|
| 打开 | Folder enters directory; file opens preview |
| 新建 | Creates file or folder |
| 查看 | Opens preview |
| 上传 | Creates mock uploaded file |
| 下载 | Creates download task and audit event |
| 移动 | Opens target selector and updates `parentId` |
| 复制 | Writes clipboard state |
| 粘贴 | Creates copy in current folder |
| 分享 | Opens share dialog and creates mock link |
| 删除 | Soft deletes node and keeps audit evidence |
| 属性 | Opens properties panel |
| 重命名 | Updates name and audit trail |

---

## 6. Lifecycle Transaction Requirements

Each module must have one or more `ModuleTransaction` records:

```text
id, moduleId, type, status, currentState, actor, createdAt, updatedAt,
relatedFileIds, relatedArtifactIds, approvals, auditTrail
```

Required states:

```text
draft, submitted, generating, evaluating, rule_checking,
schema_validating, pending_approval, approved, archived,
rejected, blocked
```

Required events:

```text
create, submit, generate, evaluate, rule_check, validate_schema,
request_approval, approve, reject, archive, reopen, block, resolve_blocker
```

All state transitions must be performed through `ModuleBackendAdapter`, so mock state can later be replaced by real OpenAPI and database transactions.

---

## 7. Approval Flow Requirements

Approval panel must show:

- Current transaction.
- Current approver.
- Approval state.
- Approval comment.
- Approve action.
- Reject action.
- Return-to-edit action.
- Transaction audit trail.

Approval must be connected to files and artifacts where relevant, not just free text.

---

## 8. AI Assistant And AI Home Requirements

`ArchIToken AI` is a global assistant and must:

- Default to folded/docked mode to avoid blocking core operations.
- Expand into profile and chat area.
- Show AI name, certified level, role, work samples, capability tags and module-context suggestions.
- Include quick actions for generate, check, approval suggestion, risk review and customer contact.
- Write current module audit events on quick actions.
- Support a profile-style AI home with recent works, capabilities and mock follow/favorite/copy-link interactions.

---

## 9. Digital Twin Requirements

The `digital_twin` module is a WebGPU-first twin canvas embedded in the same ArchIToken platform Shell as every other module. It is not a generic card page and it is not a separate dark-shell product.

Global UI requirements:

- Shell, module rail, toolbar, file dock, drawers, context menu, lifecycle, approval and AI assistant follow the active global theme.
- Default theme is `wechat_light` 白绿业务.
- `industrial_dark` and `cockpit_blue` can be selected from the platform toolbar and persisted through `architoken_theme`.
- When `wechat_light` is active, digital twin metrics, tree, monitor, gates, dock, buttons, labels, borders, text and background must be white-green. Only the central model canvas may use a professional high-contrast visualization background.

Required capability:

- WebGPU-first rendering status.
- Three.js fallback status.
- IFC/GLB semantic model.
- Point cloud for geometric measurement.
- 3DGS/SPZ as image-based reality layer.
- 360 panorama and site video.
- 3D scanning and oblique photography.
- Component tree.
- Layer manager.
- Progress comparison.
- Quality/safety/cost overlays.
- View controls.
- IoT and sensor state.
- Snapshot and model package export.

3DGS must be documented as a reality-capture visual layer. Point cloud remains the measurement/control layer.

---

## 10. Local Private Deployment Requirements

ArchIToken must support:

| Deployment Mode | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Local development | Docker Compose or equivalent local stack |
| Private single-machine install | Docker + local configuration |
| Production | Kubernetes |
| GPU workloads | k8s node selection, NVIDIA runtime/device plugin strategy |
| Offline or weak network | Local image registry, pinned dependencies, local model/provider adapters |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry-compatible logs, traces and metrics |
| Rollback | Versioned config, migration plan and health checks |

---

## 11. Acceptance Criteria

| Area | Acceptance |
|---|---|
| Naming | Active UI/docs use ArchIToken; InsomeOS only historical |
| Module IDs | 11 active IDs match registry; `production_manufacturing` is active |
| Legacy aliases | `manufacturing` and `fabrication` route to `production_manufacturing` only |
| Routing | `/app/modules/[moduleId]` displays the requested module |
| File system | Left-click and all 12 right-click operations change frontend state |
| Lifecycle | State machine transitions are visible and auditable |
| Approval | Approve/reject/return actions change transaction status |
| AI gates | Six-stage gate chain is visible for each module |
| Digital twin | Unified Shell remains active; `wechat_light` makes the whole twin workbench white-green except the central visualization canvas; WebGPU and Three.js fallback remain available |
| Adapter | Current mock adapter exposes a replaceable contract for OpenAPI/DB/Agent |
| Deployment | Docs and future implementation support k8s + Docker + local private deployment |
| Tests | Frontend lint, typecheck, tests and build must pass for frontend PRs |

---

## 12. Non-Goals For Current Mock Stage

These are not omitted; they are intentionally behind contracts:

| Area | Current State | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| Real backend | Not called by current workbench | Replace `MockModuleBackendAdapter` with OpenAPI client |
| Real database | Not mutated by frontend mock | Route through StorageRouter capability stores |
| Real agent execution | Not invoked by UI buttons | Map actions to WorkflowRouter and Agent gates |
| Real WebGPU/3DGS loader | Cockpit and fixtures exist | Add runtime detection, loaders and fallback tests |

---

## 13. 2026-04-28 Local Upload And Preview Requirements

本轮验收更新: 上传不能停留在 mock 文案。当前前端必须支持选择或拖拽本地文件,保存到 `03-frontend/.architoken/uploads/`,在 `index.json` 生成元数据,无需刷新即可进入当前模块文件列表,并绑定生命周期、审批和审计。

| File family | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Image | Inline image preview and metadata |
| Video | HTML video playback |
| Audio | HTML audio playback |
| PDF | Inline iframe/object preview |
| Text / Markdown / JSON / CSV / YAML / XML | Text preview, with JSON/CSV classified for future parser upgrade |
| Office | File information card plus download/share/archive flow |
| IFC / GLB / GLTF / DWG / DXF / STEP / E57 / LAS / PLY / SPZ | Engineering object card with import status, model-library action, parse-task action, rule-check action, archive action |
| Archive | Archive package card and archive flow |
| Unknown | Generic file object with download/share/archive flow |

Digital twin upload acceptance is stricter: IFC, GLB, point cloud, 360, 3D scan, oblique photography, and WebGPU snapshot files must appear in the digital twin data-source dock and create an import transaction.
